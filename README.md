# dockermallet
This is a customized Mallet repo (ie it has a dataset in the sample-data directory, a Dockerfile, and run_mallet.sh helper script to make Mallet easier to begin using for certain CDS workshops... <br>

2.) **Start Docker by opening Docker in your Applications folder (the Docker icon should appear in your Dock and or menubar)**  
   
# QUICKSTART   
1.) Download the zip file located at: https://github.com/ccarvel/dockermallet/releases/download/cds-custom/mallet-202108_cds-custom.zip  
> Let's assume you are downloading to your Downloads folder
   
2.) Once downloaded, open your Downloads folder and double-click mallet-202108_cds-custom.zip   
> This will create a new folder in your Downloads folder: ```~/Downloads/mallet-202108_cds-custom/```
> The tilde **~** is a placeholder/shortcut for the path on your computer equal to /Users/youruserid/, thus **~/Downloads** is the same as saying **/Users/youruserid/Downloads**      
   
3.) From this point, let's start using the Terminal by using the keyboard shortcut: ```âŒ˜+spacebar``` and typing Terminal and pressing Enter/Return or clicking the Terminal icon      
    
4.) To enter the ~/Downloads/mallet-202108_cds-custom folder within Terminal, type:  
   
```cd ~/Downloads/mallet-202108_cds-custom```  
   
5.) Let's confirm your folder has the necessary files and folders by listing its contents with the command:   
     
```ls -lah```   

   
Which should give you something similar to this this output:  
```total 176

```   
   
6.) With Docker running, you can proceed to start Mallet using the helper script run_mallet.sh:        
```./run_mallet.sh```  
*(If you receive an error trying to use the ```run_mallet.sh``` script, try running the command  
```chmod +x run_mallet.sh``` first, and then try running it again).     

> This script runs two commands...   
> The first to **build** the Mallet image is the same as running:   
> ```docker build -t mallet .```

> And the second command uses docker to **run** the image as a container:   
> ```docker run -v /${PWD}/sample-data:/usr/local/mallet/sample-data -it --name malletcds mallet bash```
  
You should see docker build Mallet and bring you into the container that holds the Mallet application and your data directory (similar to below):  
```root@a96847ae08ff:/usr/local/mallet#```   

   
The ```sample-data``` directory in your ```~/Downloads/mallet-202108_cds-custom``` folder is where you will want to add the texts you wish to analyze and model--   
This ```sample-data``` directory at ```~/Downloads/mallet-202108_cds-custom/sample-data``` is a linked directory located **within** the container at: ```usr/local/mallet/sample-data```   

   
From here you can enter Mallet commands as instructed.  
   
To run Mallet from the container, which should initially place you at ```/usr/local/mallet/``` you will type ```bin/mallet``` and whatever additional flags and commands you wish to use...    
eg ```bin/mallet import-dir --input sample-data/foldernamewithyourfiles/ --output tutorial.mallet --keep-sequence --remove-stopwords```
